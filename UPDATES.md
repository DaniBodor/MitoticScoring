## v1.10 - 27 May 2021

- Fixed bug that deletes previous overlays (cell boxes) when closing and re-opening the same file
- Discontinued 'Click OK' mode, because it's not compatible with above and anyway the least useful mode
  - 'Click OK' is potentially more stable than other modes, so if people run into crashes a lot because of this I need to look back at it (not likely)
- Clarified window naming upon load custom observation list


## v1.0 - 26 May 2021

- Fixed bugs in 'Draw only' mode
- Fixed incorrect selection of 'Progress mode' from startup settings
- Hide ROI name that is in the way when observation list pops up
